        <h2 class="title is-5">Data Protection and Privacy Notice</h2>

        <p>
          PrizeProfile is committed to protecting (i) the privacy of Users; and (ii) the confidentiality of the information provided to it by Users using the Website. However, PrizeProfile is not able to control the use by third parties of any information appearing on the Website.
        </p>

        <p>
          PrizeProfile reserves the right to gather information relating to use of the Website. Please refer to our Privacy Policy for information on how your details are used. By visiting and using the Website you consent to collection and use of this information by PrizeProfile in accordance with our Privacy Policy and warrant that all data provided by you is current, complete and accurate and will be kept up to date.

      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="title is-5">General</h2>

        <p>
          You may print and keep a copy of these Terms, which form the entire agreement between you and PrizeProfile and supersede any other communications or advertising with respect to the Website.
        </p>

        <p>
          These Terms may only be modified with the prior written consent of PrizeProfile. PrizeProfile may alter or amend these Terms at any time, with immediate effect and without notice. Please check this page from time to time to take notice of any amendments as by continuing to use the Website after such alteration, you will be deemed to have accepted any amendment to these Terms.
        </p>

        <p>
          These Terms and their performance shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales and the parties hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.
        </p>

        <p>
          You shall comply with all foreign and local laws and regulations which apply to your use of the Website in whatever country you are physically located, including without limitation, consumer law, export control laws and regulations.
        </p>

        <p>
          You agree that because of the unique nature of the Website and PrizeProfile's proprietary rights therein, a demonstrated breach of these Terms by you would irreparably harm PrizeProfile and monetary damages would be inadequate compensation. Therefore, you agree that PrizeProfile shall be entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, as determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of these Terms.
        </p>

        <p>
          If any provision of these Terms is declared void, illegal or unenforceable, the remainder of these Terms will be valid and enforceable to the extent permitted by applicable law. In such event, the parties agree to use their best efforts to replace the invalid or unenforceable provision by a provision that, to the extent permitted by the applicable law, achieves the purposes intended under the invalid or unenforceable provision.
        </p>

        <p>
          Any failure by any party to these Terms to enforce at any time any term or condition under these Terms will not be considered a waiver of that party's right thereafter to enforce each and every term and condition of these Terms.
        </p>

        <p>
          Neither party will be responsible for delays resulting from circumstances beyond the reasonable control of such party, provided that the nonperforming party uses reasonable efforts to avoid or remove such causes of non-performance and continues performance hereunder with reasonable dispatch whenever such causes are removed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nothing in these Terms shall give, directly or indirectly, any third party any enforceable benefit or any right of action against PrizeProfile and such third parties shall not be entitled to enforce any term of these Terms against PrizeProfile.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you feel that any materials appearing on the Website are offensive, objectionable or potentially defamatory please contact PrizeProfile by way of our contact page providing full details of the nature of your complaint and the materials to which the complaint relates.
