          This Privacy Policy governs your use prizeprofile.com (which we will now refer to as “PrizeProfile”), developed by Reward Digital Ltd (“PrizeProfile” or “we”).

        </p>

        <p>
          When it comes to your personal data, PrizeProfile operates on three very simple principles:

          <li>We won’t sell your personal information to others without asking you directly;</li>

        </ul>

        <p>

        </p>

          We utilise this information to:
        </h3>

        <ul class="dotted-list">
